summary=This sketch, and the associated wiring diagram, turns the UltraNano into a USB Serial Interface similar to boards based on the FT232 USB serial chip.\n\nIt supports an open-drain pulse output on port open/close for direct connection to another MCU board (such as an Arduino or chipKIT development board) as a RESET signal. No capacitor is required as you would with an FT232 board, which makes for much simpler wiring.\n\nThere are also connections for a DTR signal, both in active HIGH and active LOW varieties.\n\nThe on-board LED shows activity, both for TX and RX.\n\nThe UART interface's baud rate is automatically configured to match the requested USB interface baud rate.
